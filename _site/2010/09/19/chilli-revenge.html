							<h3>Revenge Of The Chilli</h3>
							<h5>19 Sep 2010</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I just got a boat-load of tomatoes from my father-in-laws greenhouse so I decided to cook some Chilli Con Carne. During the preparation I fried up onions, 
peppers, peas, mushrooms and chillies. After they were done I picked up the pan and as it passed my face I took a quick smell in through my nostrils.</p>

<p>The Chillies must have been very strong as when their scent was drawn up my nostrils I immediately started to get the feeling that I&#8217;d made a school boy error. 
My nose started to get a warm numb feeling. Any air drawn up my nostrils gave me the same feeling as you get in a sauna. Over the next hour this feeling continued 
until the heat had moved all the way up to my eyes. It was agony, I couldn&#8217;t open my eyes as it was too painful and they were watering so much. No matter what I 
did I couldn&#8217;t get any relief. Eventually it subsided, I laughed about it then I ate my Chilli Con Carne.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a tough lesson to learn and I certainly will not be repeating that in a hurry.</p>
