							<h3>Going Russian</h3>
							<h5>15 Aug 2010</h5>
						</header>
						<p>On a recent business trip I had the opportunity to go out for an evening meal in Glasgow. I like my food but am not a connoisseur, anything does me, but when 
someone suggested going to a Russian restaurant I was up for a first.</p>

<p>It was quite a trek so I was hoping that it was going to be worthwhile. We eventually arrived at [Cafe-Gallery Cossachok](http://www.cossachok.com0{:target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;}. It 
was modern looking with a large glass entrance. There weren&#8217;t many people in the restaurant, which is normally not a good sign, but it was pretty quiet on the 
streets so I didn&#8217;t think about that for too long. It was very clean and well laid out. The decoration was minimal but very tasteful and not over the top. 
For my starter I ordered Borscht and for my main course I ordered Chakhokhbili. I&#8217;m not a massive beetroot fan but I was pleasantly surprised at how all the 
flavours in the soup combined together to make it very sweet. I wasn&#8217;t keen on the bread that accompanied the soup but I&#8217;&#8216;m not one for leaving anything so just 
ate it anyway. No problems with the main course though, it was delicious, beautiful pieces of chicken in a spicy tomato sauce. The rice was also cooked to 
perfection. I wasn&#8217;t going to have a dessert but since everyone else was having something I went for the Kutuzov Cake which once again was delicious. 
Overall I&#8217;d have to give it a 5 star rating. I&#8217;d definitely go back even if I had to pay for it myself.</p>
