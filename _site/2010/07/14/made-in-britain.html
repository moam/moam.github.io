							<h3>Made in Britain</h3>
							<h5>14 Jul 2010</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I needed to buy a cheap bedside chest of drawers. The wife said she&#8217;d seen some in Argos. I had a look in their catalogue and they were reasonably 
priced but I wanted to get some from Ikea. It&#8217;s not my favourite shop and it&#8217;s a fair hike for me in the car but they do produce, in my opinion, fairly 
high quality stuff at affordable prices. In fact they were priced exactly the same. However the wife wasn&#8217;t happy with that and told me to get them 
from Argos to save a journey since it&#8217;s just down the road. Best be a good boy and comply.</p>

<p>So off I go to Argos, collected said item and return home minus £25. As I unpacked and examined the components I was less than impressed with the 
quality. It was shocking. Not only were the panels poor quality but the fittings were also very poor, nothing like Ikea. Nevertheless I knocked it 
together fairly quickly and put it in its resting place. Against other Ikea furniture in the room it looked out of place.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I was disposing of the packaging, in a very ecological and green way, that I noticed that the instructions had a large union jack on 
the front proudly displaying the words &#8220;MADE IN BRITAIN&#8221;. Enough said.</p>
