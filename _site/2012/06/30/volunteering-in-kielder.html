							<h3>Volunteering in Kielder</h3>
							<h5>30 Jun 2012</h5>
						</header>
						<p>My employer allows me to dedicate 3 days a year to volunteering so I took the opportunity to do some work in Kielder which is very close to my heart.</p>

<p>The task was to help construct a mountain bike trail. I was prepared for the hard work but not the Midges. Those little buggers played total havoc. Luckily we were given 
Midge nets by the organisers which helped a great deal. In hindsight I should have worn a long sleeved t-shirt as during the morning session I got a few bites on the 
underside of my forearms despite having sprayed myself with the recommended protection. I switched to a long sleeved fleece in the afternoon but this increased my 
temperature which wasn&#8217;t ideal given the my physical nature of the afternoon activities but it was better than being eaten alive.</p>

<p>I think the team I was with did a massive amount of work and everyone had a great time despite the hard work. In case you were wondering, as I know how concerned you&#8217;ll 
be, the bites had completely vanished the next morning so no itching or scratching. I would have no hesitation in doing it all again.</p>
