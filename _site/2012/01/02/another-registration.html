							<h3>Not Another Account Registration</h3>
							<h5>02 Jan 2012</h5>
						</header>
						<p>What is the obsession with online retailers requiring you to create an account before you purchase?
I recently had an experience with <a href="http://www.clarks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Clarks</a> the high street and online shoe retailer. I wanted to get some shoes in their sale 
and they didn&#8217;t have them in-store so I thought about ordering them online for delivery to a local store (which by the way is an excellent service, no purchase necessary). 
I went to their online store but as usual you needed to register before purchase. So I decided to call them to order rather than placing it online. I explained to the nice 
lady that I wanted to order something but I didn&#8217;t want an online account as this would most likely be a one off purchase, at least online anyway. No problem Mr Dobson. 
The order was place and that was that or so I thought. A few minutes later I received 3 emails, one confirming my order, one confirming my account name and the other 
confirming my temporary password. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to call again so just decided never to use details. Hopefully they&#8217;ll just expire if not used.</p>
