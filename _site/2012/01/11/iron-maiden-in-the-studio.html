<p>In my younger days I was a massive fan of Iron Maiden so when I stumbled across a couple of books, dedicated to them, on Amazon it sparked my interest.</p>

<p>Initially I wanted to get my hands on a copy of &#8220;Run to the Hills: Iron Maiden - The Authorised Biography by Mick Wall&#8221; but I discovered that it was quite old and not in 
print any longer so I settled for this more recently published book.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly familiar with their back story having read many previous articles and watched many DVD&#8217;s so I was hoping for something new and interesting. Unfortunately I got 
neither from this book. The book was basically a condensed amalgamation of other material (interviews and other published articles) formatted into an album per chapter. I 
had high hopes for this book and whilst the format made reading easy each chapter repeated many of the quotes, anecdotes and themes of the last until it got very boring.</p>

<p>Overall this was an average book. Interesting for any new fans but not really suited to those that are knowledgeable about the band. I would have been very disappointed if 
I&#8217;d paid the £17.99 RRP (for the hardback edition). As it happens I paid £9.18 from Amazon which I suppose wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
