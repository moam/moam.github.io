<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Steven. Welcome to my site - a place for my stuff, opinions and trivia. Interestingly, or not &#8230;</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am not a web designer, front-end developer, illustrator or a freelancer.</li>
  <li>I am not a part time or professional musician. I can&#8217;t even play an instrument.</li>
  <li>I don&#8217;t like coffee or any other caffeinated beverage and have never been to Starbucks.</li>
  <li>Twitter and Facebook are a load of shite and totally pointless.</li>
  <li>I am not an ex-Navy Seal and have no experience of weapons and tactics.</li>
</ul>

<p>There, that&#8217;s covered most of the cliches.</p>

<p>I live in beautiful Northumberland on the North East coast of England. When I&#8217;m not working, which is a major inconvenience, I love to go on long
walks with my family and dog, who&#8217;s called Molly, in the coast and countryside of Northumberland. I also enjoy music, bird watching, intelligent TV and 
reading.</p>

<h5 id="the-history">The History</h5>

<p>Many years ago I wanted to learn about CSS, HTML and the LAMP stack but to put learning into practice you need a project. So I got myself a hosting 
plan (the name of the company escapes me) and bought myself a domain <em>sdobson.com</em>. I flirted with this project but didn&#8217;t really do much and eventually
the project went tits-up and I let the domain expire.</p>

<p>Sometime later (FFS this is as vague as Paul Di&#8217;Anno&#8217;s <a href="http://scriptogr.am/sdobson/post/quick-book-review">book</a>) I got the bug again so decided to 
start again. I got myself another hosting plan <a href="http://www.justhostme.co.uk">Justhostme</a> and was lucky enough to get <em>sdobson.com</em> back. I was fortunate 
to come across an excellent tutorial from Leigh Mackay who used to own and run <em>http://www.phpvideotutorials.com</em> (he has since given this domain away) 
which demonstrated the fundamentals of the MVC framework (as well as the [W/L]AMP environment) to develop a blog similar to Tumblr. This helped me 
get to grips with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Apache. You can find out more about Leigh at <a href="http://observable.com.au">Observable</a>.</p>

<p>With the site completed I tried so hard to concentrate more on content and less on my obsessive fiddling with the design but I just couldn&#8217;t. I would 
go onto the computer and instead of posting something I would start fiddling around with the code. I got a bit bored with that and things came to a head 
when I last renewed the hosting plan. Things got out of hand (charges went up; VAT was now being added to the prices advertised on their web site etc.) 
and I questioned the need to spend the money. So I decided to once again cancel the hosting plan and domain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d decided to just do without anything until I started looking into Linux when I bought myself a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>. This 
seemed to be the ideal solution - a low powered device (and thus cheap to run) which I could leave on all the time and which could host my very own 
LAMP stack. Also at the time I&#8217;d stumbled across some excellent tutorials by Jesse Boyer at <a href="http://jream.com/">JREAMdesign</a>. I worked through the 
tutorials to come up with a new site which used the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> along with a dynamic DNS service from <a href="http://www.noip.com/">NOIP</a>. </p>

<p>I was happy with these arrangements until I discovered my employer had blocked access to my site (well more specific sites which are hosted with 
<a href="http://www.noip.com/">NOIP</a>). This pissed me off as it limited when and how I could provide updates. So I was in the market for another solution and 
up stepped <a href="http://scriptogr.am">scriptogr.am</a> and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">dropbox</a>. Initially I was very impressed with the way this worked but as time 
went on I noticed that their (Scriptogram&#8217;s) site wasn&#8217;t being updated and sometimes the interface for managing the site was becoming less and less reliable.</p>

<p>Just before 2014 I started looking round for another way to reinvent the site and I came across GitHub and Jekyll. Initially I was considering hosting Jekyll 
on the Raspberry Pi and running it that way but I realised that it was much easier to use GitHub. And here we are.</p>
