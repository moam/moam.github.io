							<h3>UK Pathetic On Asylum Seekers #1</h3>
							<h5>02 Feb 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I nearly choked on my morning apple when I read an article about an asylum seeker in this morning&#8217;s Metro newspaper. I cannot believe how pathetic this country is 
in regards to these people. I don&#8217;t deny there are some genuine cases but the article details made my blood boil and showed just how much a soft touch we are.</p>

<p>Firstly it says that the individual won her right to stay in Britain at the <strong>fourth</strong> (you heard it right) attempt. Her other three attempts were all rejected. 
Additionally two of them were submitted under false names. Eh WFT you got to be kidding me right? No I&#8217;m not. Now call me whatever you like but I would say that 
you should get one attempt at this. No second chances to come up with another story or to delay the process. The fact that she applied using a false name should 
have been grounds for instant deportation but no she is given 4 attempts. This is an insult.</p>

<p>Secondly the &#8220;unnamed&#8221; mother arrived here from Tanzania in 1995. She has two children 12 and 9 by a British man. The outcome of the case was dictated by the fact 
that she has 2 children who were born here and are British citizens. The result was in their best interests. Now hang on here. When she arrived she did not have 
any children so however cruel this is, that should have had no bearing on the case. Knowing that she might be deported at any time she chose to have children, no 
one forced her to have them and come on who wouldn&#8217;t use that as a great bargaining chip in any asylum trial. I feel so sorry for the children but she should not 
have been allowed to stay.</p>

<p>How can the process have taken 15 years? How can this be allowed, it&#8217;s just plain stupid, irrational and an insult to UK nationals who are being stretched to the 
limit.</p>

<p>Campaigners hailed the decision as a &#8220;significant step forward&#8221;. Who the hell are these people, I would like to know because I cannot understand why they would 
say that unless they had a huge interest in allowing anyone into this country with absolutely no grounds to be here.</p>
