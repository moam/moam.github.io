							<h3>An Expensive Dog Walk</h3>
							<h5>22 Feb 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I shouldn&#8217;t complain really because my faithful mutt has never been a problem before whilst on holiday however this time it was a bloody pain in the proverbial. 
I was looking forward to a nice break after being very busy at work and with other personal stuff. We were in a remote countryside location in a nice timber 
lodge. We decided to go for another walk as a family. During the walk the dog picked up a stick and after taking a few steps one end jarred on the ground and the 
other into her mouth. We quickly examined her and gave her a drink and she seemed OK. When we got back to the lodge she became subdued and was refusing water and 
food. Unfortunately my wife was rather concerned and wanted to take the dog to the vets just in case the stick was lodged in her throat. How I know that the dog 
is usually totally pathetic when there is a slight hint of her feeling a little under the weather so I wanted to wait however she was salivating rather a lot so I 
was overruled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was in the middle of nowhere, too far away from my local vets, so I had to find one that was local, open and available to see her. We eventually 
found one, the closest being a 45 minute drive along windy unlit country roads. Great! Needless to say I was not the happiest of people. After a 3 hour wait we 
picked her up after a full check-up revealed nothing but a minor graze to the roof of her mouth. For my trouble I was relieved of £190. The next day she was as 
right as rain. Thanks. I love my dog (as I should because I paid for her) but she will be my first and last.</p>
