							<h3>Jobsworth</h3>
							<h5>08 Feb 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>This kind of story really makes my blood boil because it demonstrates how truly pathetic some people are. You&#8217;re busy getting on with your life in a quiet and 
unassuming way and some arsehole comes along and defies rational logic.</p>

<p>So what the hell am I referring to? Well we turn to the Metro, everyone&#8217;s favourite free newspaper, once again. In today&#8217;s edition a news snippet tells how posh 
TV Presenter Ben Fogle was threatened with a fine after his energy-saving car was deemed to be &#8220;parked&#8221; at a junction. His car has a stop/start eco-engine and it 
turned off at traffic lights. A warden threatened to ticket him as he was &#8220;parked&#8221;. What idiot would do that? He should have been knocked out for that then sacked 
for gross incompetence.</p>

<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough for poor Ben he was also suffering after hurting his leg the previous week while tackling a fox which had attacked his dogs. What a bloke.</p>
