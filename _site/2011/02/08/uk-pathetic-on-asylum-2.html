							<h3>UK Pathetic On Asylum Seekers #2</h3>
							<h5>08 Feb 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>FFS this is getting to be a habit and I blame the Metro and the Daily Express.</p>

<p>Another tale in today&#8217;s Metro, not as bad as before but in the same vein. The article describes how a Ugandan woman won a further (implying there have been more 
than one) court order preventing her from being deported by claiming she was a lesbian.</p>

<p>The woman who should have been deported on January 28 said she feared for her life in Uganda where there is hostility towards homosexuals. Now that is mighty 
convenient wouldn&#8217;t you say, and I do. I doubt that when she arrives back in Uganda there is going to be a &#8220;welcoming&#8221; party waiting outside ready to lynch her. 
She&#8217;ll just be another face in the crown, unless she&#8217;s wearing a big sign saying &#8220;lesbian&#8221; or something particular about her that says &#8220;look at me I&#8217;m a 
lesbian&#8221;. If it&#8217;s so bad in Uganda then she needs to keep a low profile. I don&#8217;t agree with it but you have to deal with local conditions as best as you can. 
It&#8217;s not a reason to seek asylum in another country. FFS next we&#8217;ll be getting people coming in claiming they can&#8217;t be deported because they&#8217;ll be ridiculed for 
having a large nose or big ears.</p>

<p>The final insult is an immigration judge found she was not gay. I wonder how they came to that conclusion. Keep it clean!</p>
