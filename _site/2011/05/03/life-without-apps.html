							<h3>My Life Without Apps</h3>
							<h5>03 May 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Yes folks I have to confess I don&#8217;t possess an iPhone and hence cannot &#8220;benefit&#8221; from Apps. What a hardship I hear you say, how can he survive? I feel like an 
outcast, like the kid at school who couldn&#8217;t afford Adidas trainers and had to get Gola. What a looser.</p>

<p>Of course this is in jest (well at least it is to me) but according to the latest Apple adverts to hit my TV screen maybe its closer to reality than I think. The 
advert goes something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone you don&#8217;t have the App Store so you don&#8217;t have the world largest selection of apps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No kidding Einstein. Big deal so your sad little life is empty because you don&#8217;t have an app to check-in for your flight or buy a coffee. Come on get a life 
please. You just don&#8217;t need a £500 phone to do that. I&#8217;m sure the next time I&#8217;m going on a flight I&#8217;ll just check-in normally at the airport and should I 
choose to buy any beverage (which won&#8217;t be coffee since I don&#8217;t drink it) I&#8217;ll put my hand in my pocket and pay for it using something called money.</p>

<p>This is typical marketing bollocks; people must be lapping it up just gagging to get their hands on an iPhone. Well I can&#8217;t knock Apple to much because I have an 
iPod which is marvellous but they certainly no how to hook people in with smart marketing for what essentially are pointless gimmicks. Have people forgotten 
life before iPhone? I think they have and are now incapable of doing anything without resorting to an app.</p>

<p>The advert finishes by uttering this totally random sentence which I just don&#8217;t get. What the hell does it mean?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don&#8217;t have an iPhone well you don&#8217;t have an iPhone</p>
</blockquote>
