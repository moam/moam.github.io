							<h3>Mobile Phone Madness</h3>
							<h5>11 May 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I thought it was about time the wife had a pay monthly SIM as I was sick of her eating through a PAYG top-up. To achieve this however I needed to get the phone 
(a LG GW520) unlocked. So I went to the &#8220;barrow-man&#8221; in the local shopping centre and 15 minutes later and £12 lighter it was unlocked.</p>

<p>A new Tesco SIM card was inserted and bob&#8217;s your uncle as they say, 500 minutes and 5000 texts all for the measly sum of £10 per month. Good value if I say so 
myself. Of course that&#8217;s not good enough for me; oh no I had to go and try to update the phone to the latest software. What a complete nightmare. 
&#8220;Please back up all data on phone first using PC Suite&#8221; which I didn&#8217;t have. When I eventually got it downloaded and installed, it just wouldn&#8217;t recognise the 
phone even though the LG Mobile Update application could see it fine. Eventually after frigging about for ages I took it upon myself to actually read a poorly 
worded pop up which I must admit I&#8217;d ignored previously because I thought it referred to the update process and not the installation process. This told me to turn 
off the phone, remove the battery and then connect the phone. Success, after installation of a driver it was recognised. So I backed up everything, updated the 
phone and attempted to restore. Now what, it&#8217;s asking for a password, what bloody password there was no mention of a password. Time for a quick Google and 
hey presto a password 0000. Contacts restored and one happy wife. Another job successfully completed by yours truly. Time for a chocolate muffin, I deserve it.</p>
