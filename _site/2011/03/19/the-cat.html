							<h3>The Cat</h3>
							<h5>19 Mar 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>It was a sad day today as my cat passed away at the ripe old age of 17. She led a very good life and was well looked after. Her health had deteriorated over the 
last few months as she developed a nasty cough which seemed to take the wind out of her. Her back legs were also giving way and occasionally she would just keel 
over.</p>

<p>She seemed well enough in the morning and was her usual vocal self when we came in with the shopping. Later on in the afternoon she has a particularity sever 
attack. On this occasion it looked bad. After staggering into the conservatory she seemed like she was going to recover but as she lay down I could tell she was 
on the way out. I tried to comfort her but she just wasn&#8217;t responding. Her breathing was very measured and she was taking in great gasps of air. I decided to 
leave her in peace. Shortly after I looked into the conservatory and could see that she wasn&#8217;t breathing. It was very upsetting.</p>

<p>We never really saw eye to eye. Her fine fur and the mess she made in her later life with the litter tray didn&#8217;t agree with me. I always thought it would be a 
relief when she passed away but it wasn&#8217;t. It was a very sad occasion as she had been part of my life for so long. Ironically it was also the 2nd birthday of my 
dog. RIP Maisey.</p>
