							<h3>Rip Off England</h3>
							<h5>01 Apr 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe the news that Scotland has joined Wales and Northern Ireland in providing prescriptions free of charge. This means English patients will be 
forced to pay prescription charges - currently £7.40 per item - while effectively subsidising free drugs for those elsewhere in the UK. Forget Rip-off Britain, 
think Rip-off England.</p>

<p>This is the latest example of &#8220;medical apartheid&#8221;, where the devolved nations enjoy better health services despite paying far less tax per head.</p>

<p>FFS when you look at the list of who is exempt from paying for prescriptions, no the wonder they&#8217;re as expensive as they are, us poor suckers who are paying for 
them are also paying for everyone else. I don&#8217;t believe this is the way prescriptions should be funded. I believe that everyone irrespective of condition should 
contribute to their medicine even a nominal amount 50p or £1 something like that. That way the paying public should pay slightly less, after all I am paying for 
my care in the NHS (in taxes and national insurance) as well as prescription charges for the same treatment as someone who pays nothing - that&#8217;s unfair.</p>

<p>What the hell do we get instead I wondered? (as they claim Scotland et al have a pot of money and decided to provide this generous offer instead of something 
else, England decided to opt for something else but what the hell is it?).</p>

<p>But hang on it&#8217;s not only free prescriptions were talking about here. The Scottish people also receive free eye tests (compared to the English charge of around 
£19) and free &#8220;personal care&#8221; in old age, while English pensioners have to pay full residential care costs if they own assets of more than £23,000. To top it all, 
Scottish students pay no tuition fees; (English students have to pay to attend a Scottish university). Students born south of the border face paying up to £9,000 
a year.</p>

<p>Yes it&#8217;s a big fat RIP-OFF ENGLAND!!</p>
