							<h3>Bloody Malware, Trojans and Viruses</h3>
							<h5>09 Apr 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Let&#8217;s face it, computers are temperamental at the best of times, especially if you&#8217;re using Windows, but things get even more complicated for even hardened 
computer geeks when you throw Malware, Trojans and Viruses into the mix.</p>

<p>At one time all you&#8217;d get was some twat gluing your locks, egging your windows or slashing your tyres now you have some smartarse trying to screw up your 
computer. FFS they don&#8217;t even need to be anywhere near you to totally mess things up.</p>

<p>Take today as a case in point. My daughter thrust her laptop in my face saying she has this strange message on the screen. As soon as I looked at the message my 
gut feeling was Malware, Trojan or Virus. It was a very official looking application called &#8220;MS Removal Tool&#8221;. I immediately knew something was up because the 
McAfee shield was not present in the notification area. I tried opening McAfee, Task Manager and the Command Prompt but none of them worked. I right-clicked the 
taskbar icon and my suspicions were confirmed when the application was named <strong>iDp24512f0cJf24511.exe</strong>. Now call me suspicious but I&#8217;m sure a legitimate 
application developer would be hard pushed to call their application by that crazy name.</p>

<p>After a bit of research the actual removal was quite straightforward. A lot of the solutions I read about involved downloading further &#8220;spyware&#8221; removal tools 
which I was a bit dubious about since the sites were not what I would call mainstream but for me this was not required.</p>

<ul>
  <li>boot into safe mode with networking (keep pressing F8 when the PC starts then select safe mode with networking)</li>
  <li>delete the folder C:\ProgramData\iDp24512f0cJf24511 which contains the file iDp24512f0cJf24511.exe - in your case it&#8217;ll probably be a different set of random 
characters</li>
  <li>open the registry (regedit.exe) and find the following key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce</li>
  <li>there will probably be only 1 entry with a name of iDp24512f0cJf24511 and a data value of C:\ProgramData\iDp24512f0cJf24511\iDp24512f0cJf24511.exe - 
once again in your case it&#8217;ll probably be a different set of random characters - delete this key</li>
  <li>some of the articles I read mentioned that the hosts file and/or the browser LAN settings may have been changed but neither were for me</li>
  <li>I also deleted all browser cache &amp; cookies as well as everything in the temp folder (C:\Users[YourName]\AppData\Local\Temp)</li>
  <li>I ran a virus scan which came up clean</li>
</ul>

<p>Job done, everything back to normal. I also took the liberty of downgrading the user account from Administrator to User.</p>
