							<h3>Political Correctness Gone Mad</h3>
							<h5>04 Jan 2011</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I read with amusement an article in the <a href="http://www.cwu.org" target="_blank">CWU</a> Voice Magazine (Telecoms and Financial Services Edition January &amp; February 
2011 issue) on page 12. I was particularly intrigued by the LGBT community conference (for those that don&#8217;t know and it was news to me this means Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual and Transgender). Why single out that group of people? By doing this and not just having a general conference they are highlighting the fact that they 
see themselves as a minority when they are in fact just like anyone else. Where is the heterosexual representation, this is discriminatory.</p>

<p>There were some classic quotes like National Equality Office Linda Roy who questioned why people were still afraid to come out. Linda was particularly disgusted 
(yes that&#8217;s right disgusted) by the world of football where 10 years after the suicide of John Fashanu</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; no other footballer has come out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, maybe there are no LGBT footballers or maybe they have no need to publically come out. Why have they got to do this, it&#8217;s their own business and no one 
else&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Also Thierry Schaffauser (made up name, only kidding), an activist who has been involved in organising the GMB&#8217;s sex worker branch (what?), stressed how important 
it is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230; for sex workers to be seen as part of the labour movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mind boggles.</p>

<p>And finally Sandie Maile, Equality and Research Office at the Prospect Union suggested that bisexual people were some way behind gays and lesbians in being 
understood. Eh, what&#8217;s difficult to understand about that? She recalls a survey in Brighton that found one third of bisexual people had experienced bullying and 
harassment from gay men and lesbians. So gay men and lesbians are no better than the homophobic heterosexual people who they claim persecute them so much.</p>

<p>One last note, the words <strong>transphobic bullying</strong> is mentioned. That&#8217;s a new one on me. Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> 
for more information.</p>
