							<h3>Microsoft You're Fired</h3>
							<h5>20 May 2009</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I received a call from Microsoft this afternoon. I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it was in relation to my complain letter or my previous communication via email. 
In any case I&#8217;m still deeply unhappy that I can&#8217;t get someone to actually answer my question and admit they made a cock-up. They are saying that my 
Son&#8217;s XBOX360 Live account is corrupt which is why the link to his Windows Live ID was severed. However, I pointed out to the caller that the XBOX360 
Live account was working fine. He offered no explanation as to why his Windows Live ID was deleted without cause. Instead he offered us a code which 
would allow us to sign up to XBL for another 12 months. That means that he would have to basically start all over again (new gamertag, no gamer score). 
That option is out of the question at the moment. However it would appear that there will be no problems renewing his subscription next February so 
we&#8217;ll just leave it for now. Only issue without Windows Live ID will be we can&#8217;t manage the XBL account on-line.</p>

<p>Checked my emails a few days later and there is indeed a free XOBX360 Live serial code in the email however they also say that the XBL account is 
corrupt and a check of their records indicates that it has never been on line and has no achievements or score. There is something seriously wrong 
because he is on line and has 4000 points. So I&#8217;m going to send them some screenshots of his TV to prove it.</p>
