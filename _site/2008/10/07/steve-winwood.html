							<h3>Steve Winwood</h3>
							<h5>07 Oct 2008</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Before I launch into <a href="http://www.stevewinwood.com" target="_blank">Steve Winwood</a> I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed 
<a href="http://www.thesagegateshead.org" target="_blank">The Sage (Gateshead)</a>. What a fantastic venue</p>

<p>This was a late edition to my end of year gig-fest but I wasn&#8217;t disappointed. Steve Winwood and his 4 piece band were fantastic. I&#8217;m not that 
familiar with his back catalogue (pre 80&#8217;&#8217;s) so it&#8217;s difficult for me to comment on his song selection. He has a new album out and his tour was 
to promote that album and I guess he did a number of tracks from that album. He did play a few numbers I recognised namely &#8220;Gimme Some Lovin&#8221;, 
&#8220;Higher Love&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m A Man&#8221;. There was an encore where 2 further songs were performed. At the end, after almost 2 hours, Steve and the band were 
given a standing ovation which lasted a good 5 minutes. The audience was predominantly the older generation but that didn&#8217;t stop us from clapping, 
cheering and dancing (not me btw) which added to the great atmosphere. One or two people on the way out did comment that they wished he&#8217;d done more 
of his hits but when you&#8217;re promoting new material it&#8217;s that you want to do rather than older stuff.</p>

<p>The whole experience was a bit strange given my regular attendance at the Carling Academy. No drunk teenagers or students, no flying plastic glasses or 
lager etc. It was all a bit to squeaky clean but not in a bad way, maybe I&#8217;m just not used to it. BUT I thought it was brilliant nevertheless, the 
sound quality was excellent and you could actually hear Steve singing and speaking. To be honest the band looked a bit lost on the stage it was so 
big.</p>

<p>Next up we have the complete opposite end of the scale. It&#8217;s Dragonforce at the Carling Academy Wed 08 Oct 2008.</p>
