						<p>Wow this gig had its ups and downs.</p>

<p>Firstly like most people I hate queues. For DragonForce the queue was crazy BUT it went down very quickly. This time I got in the queue about half 
way round from where I was for DragonForce. BUT for some reason this time instead of going down Westgate road, round the corner and back up the path 
opposite the Old Assembly Rooms it went down Westgate Road round the statue at the bottom and back up the road past the Old Assembly rooms. I waited 
and waited watching a steady stream of people walking past me safe in the knowledge that I further up the queue that I was for Dragonforce. We finally 
started moving but to my amazement when I went round the corner of the bus towards the statue I saw the queue I&#8217;d been standing in making its way 
back up the path on the opposite side of the tour buses towards the back of the queue. For some reason the people making their way past our queue 
and/or the people joining from Clayton Street must have started to form a queue on the path, therefore we were standing like idiots totally unaware 
of this other queue.</p>

<p>I followed for a few yards then thought no way was I going to stand for that shit so I turned round went back towards the 
statue, just round the corner and slid myself into the queue. If anyone did see me they didn&#8217;t mention it. I waited and waited and although we did 
move a few yards we stood for ages without moving. There was a delay but no explained what it was. When I eventually got in the support band was 
already playing. Shortly I spotted the couple at the bar who I&#8217;d pushed in front of so I went and apologised but they said they hadn&#8217;t notice me. 
Nevertheless I felt absolved as I&#8217;d at least take the time to apologise. I also spotted the people who&#8217;d be behind me in the original queue and asked 
what they&#8217;d done. They said they went further up the path then squeezed in as well. They were only a few minutes behind me in getting in so it 
wouldn&#8217;t have been that bad.</p>

<p>Right now I was in I took a good spot to watch the support band that as I said had already started. I had no idea who the hell they were but when 
I&#8217;d stopped being agitated after the queue business I though the guitarist was <a href="http://www.michaelschenkerhimself.com" target="_blank">Michael Schenker</a>. Later 
on this guess was confirmed (see Scorpions section). I guessed the band was Schenker&#8217;s band MSG but later I found out it was supposed to be an 
acoustic set with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Barden" target="_blank">Gary Barden</a>. I&#8217;m not familiar with their music and maybe I would have enjoyed it more 
if I&#8217;d see it from the start and it wasn&#8217;t acoustic BUT it was shit, that cheesy soft rock stuff. FFS Gary Barden was wearing a silver glitter suit, 
WTF. After a while the singer got a message from the side of the stage to say that was that and off they went. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>On came the <a href="http://www.the-scorpions.com/english" target="_blank">Scorpions</a>. The audience we well up for it and they weren&#8217;t disappointed. The 
stage set wasn&#8217;t spectacular more adequate but it&#8217;s not exactly huge anyway so they did what they could. Some of the songs were new to me off their 
latest album although I have listened to it and did recognise the tracks. The main set list was derived from their albums during the 80&#8217;s and 
early 90&#8217;s (songs like &#8220;The Zoo&#8221;, &#8220;Another Piece Of Meat&#8221;, &#8220;Blackout&#8221;, &#8220;Dynamite&#8221; etc.) which is my era although I also enjoy all of their stuff 
from the 70&#8217;s best. The group were joined mid way by Michael Schenker as they belted out the classics &#8220;Coast To Coast&#8221;, &#8220;Holiday&#8221; and &#8220;Lovedrive&#8221;. 
After a brilliant set they came back out and did 4 encore songs finishing off with &#8220;Winds of Change&#8221; (not one of my favourites as it&#8217;s a bit slow) 
then &#8220;Rock You Like a Hurricane&#8221;. Wow what a great set from start to finish and they&#8217;d been on for 110 minutes, not bad.</p>

<p>Right folks next up Elbow on Mon 20 October 2008 at Sage Gateshead. It&#8217;s another chance for me to see this brilliant band and also get a seat to rest my 
tired legs.</p>
