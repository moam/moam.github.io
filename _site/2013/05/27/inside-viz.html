							<h3>Chris Donald - The Inside Story of Viz</h3>
							<h5>27 May 2013</h5>
						</header>
						<p>This book was absolutely brilliant and for anyone who knows about Viz it&#8217;s an absolute must read. It was a fantastic from start to finish. 
This wasn&#8217;t just words on a page that someone had regurgitated with some vagueness (which spoils many a potentially good read) this was the emotional, 
passionate, funny and accurate account of Chris Donald&#8217;s 20 year &#8216;hobby&#8217; as editor of Viz.</p>

<p>The story charts the highs and lows of the magazine from its infancy in Chris&#8217;s Newcastle bedroom to it being one of the most circulated magazines 
(comics) in the UK. As the story unfolds and the popularity of Viz escalates you feel for Chris because through external publishing pressures Viz succumbed 
to commercialism and with that some of the control he has is lost which results in the Viz &#8216;brand&#8217; being diluted as deals get done and external writers 
try, and fail miserably, to emulate the Viz teams humour. Forget the videos, animated TV shows etc. for me the true essence of Viz is the magazine (comic). 
The one thing I regret is that I no longer own any issues (I don&#8217;t recall which ones I had as it was nearly 30 years ago) but I remember being at school 
and everyone raving about it.</p>

<p>One more thing which comes through the writing is Chris&#8217;s humour and writing style. It&#8217;s particularly appropriate because we&#8217;re both from the North 
East and it hit the right notes for me. To finish off I&#8217;m going to give you a few examples.</p>

<p>Chris talks about a meeting his brother Simon had with Jimmy Nail (of Spender and Aufedersein Pet fame)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simon and Jimmy met up back in Newcastle and they got on like a house ahad <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris recalls his night at the Welsh BAFTAS in particular the seating arrangements and the fight to site next to Catherine Zeta-Jones</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Phil Morrow had hit the jackpot. The spawny <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> bastard was right next to her and on her other arm was a beaming Tony Barnes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally Chris describes the time he went on Radio 1 with Simon Bates who got a bit too personal with their private conversation live on air</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And how&#8217;s that new Beamer <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> of yours driving? He probably call it professionalism, but I&#8217;d call it a cunt&#8217;s trick <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a book which I shall treasure forever. If only I could get is signed then that would be the icing on the cake. </p>

<p>Now go and buy it. Published by <a href="http://harpercollins.co.uk">Harper Collins</a> ISBN 978-0-00-733034-8</p>
