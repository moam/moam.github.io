							<h3>Barter Books</h3>
							<h5>29 May 2013</h5>
						</header>
						<p>If you&#8217;ve read any of my previous posts (and I hope you have) then you&#8217;ll notice <a href="http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/">Barter Books</a> features quite a bit. That&#8217;s 
because I love going there and trying to find myself a good read.</p>

<p>In got the reading bug back after many years of not reading anything more than a newspaper. I can&#8217;t remember how it happened (there must have been a book 
which acted as a catalyst but I can&#8217;t remember it) but I&#8217;m glad it did because I feel better for it. I find the best time to read is just before I go 
to sleep. It helps me relax but unfortunately I tend to only read for a short time before my eyes are closing so books usually take a long time to read. 
So books with around 200-300 pages are the ones I usually go for.</p>

<p>I had a pile of books I wanted to trade in so a trip to <a href="http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/">Barter Books</a> was on my itinerary of things to do this week. 
I also fancied a stroll around the lovely town of <a href="http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/">Alnwick</a> as I expected the weather to be nice and sunny.</p>

<p>I got there early but with it being half-term it was already quite busy. After waiting around 20 minutes for my books to be assessed I was pleased to 
break even so I didn&#8217;t actually own any money. The books I picked up were</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dirk Gently&#8217;s Holistic Detective Agency - Douglas Adams</li>
  <li>On The Symb-Socket Circuit - Kenneth Bulmer</li>
  <li>The Fountains Of Paradise - Arthur C Clarke</li>
  <li>Silent Bob Speaks - Kevin Smith</li>
  <li>The Top Gear Story - Martin Roach</li>
  <li>Jeremy Clarkson The Biography - Gwen Russell</li>
  <li>Death Comes To Pemberley - PD James (for the wife of course)</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a discrete enquiry regarding Chris Donald but unfortunately I am 5 years too late. He doesn&#8217;t work there anymore.</p>

<p>After finishing up in <a href="http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/">Barter Books</a> I took a short stroll into <a href="http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/">Alnwick</a> town centre 
where I enjoyed a look round the shops and a welcome bite to eat at <a href="https://plus.google.com/104583187534531209948/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en">Baileys Of Alnwick</a>. </p>
