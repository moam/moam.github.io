							<h3>Work Based Chuggers</h3>
							<h5>09 Mar 2013</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Chuggers or &#8216;Charity Muggers&#8217; on the high street have never bothered me because you&#8217;re in an open space and can easily ignore them or if you&#8217;re careful bypass 
them altogether. But when you&#8217;re at work it&#8217;s a different story. You&#8217;re in a confined space and usually these people are colleagues who you know. So saying NO to 
their latest charity drive can be awkward.</p>

<p>Take the last few days for example. It&#8217;s close to Red Nose Day and it&#8217;s unbelievable how many &#8216;money buckets&#8217; rattle round the office. I know it&#8217;s for a good 
cause but I&#8217;m sick and tired of this kind of Chugging. I have a simple policy and that&#8217;s to say NO to anyone who asks me to make a contribution. Call me what you 
like but it saves me forking out a small fortune in the fortnight leading up to the event not to mention the day itself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately saying NO gets the same reaction as if you&#8217;d just told them to fuck off - they look at you like you&#8217;re a piece of shit. But I stand by my policy. 
After all I pay a lot of tax which the government, bless them, decide to gift to many foreign countries. As they say charity begins at home and I for one intent 
to spend any spare money I have in that very place treating my family now and again.</p>
