							<h3>Is The Cinema Value For Money?</h3>
							<h5>09 Jun 2013</h5>
						</header>
						<p>I like going to the cinema as the experience of watching a movie on a large screen with brilliant sound is awesome. However the problem is that it&#8217;s too 
expensive and there are too many mediocre films which promise much but deliver little.</p>

<p>Yesterday I took my two kids to see the new Will Smith film <a href="http://www.afterearth.com">After Earth</a>. For 1 adult and 2 teenagers it was relieved of 
£24.30 which I think is expensive. Then you have to content with the exorbitant food prices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 x Milkybar Giant Buttons £2.99</li>
  <li>1 x Large Ice Blast £3.95</li>
  <li>1 x Regular Hot Dog Combo £7.25
    <ul>
      <li>1 x Medium Hot Dog</li>
      <li>1 x Medium Ice Blast</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TOTAL £14.19</li>
</ul>

<p>Now when you consider <a href="http://www.asda.com">Asda</a> sells the Milkybar Giant Buttons for £1 (and they must be making a profit on that price) that is a massive 
markup. Given that the Large Ice Blast was £3.95 assume a reduction for the medium which would make the Hot Dog around £3.50 to £4. That was (probably) 
a cheap white bun along with the cheapest sausage (consider they retail around £2 for eight). Once again they are making a massive profit on those items. 
Basically they are ripping you off.</p>

<p>If all these costs were brought under control I&#8217;m sure they would see more foot-fall at the Cinema along with less piracy. After all why watch a lower 
grade (ripped / encoded) copy of a film on your TV when you can go to a Cinema and experience the full package.</p>

<p>On the subject of the film my personal view is that it was very mediocre. The story line was predictable, clichéd and full of holes. The acting was 
wooden and it takes nepotism to a new level. Will Smith was particularly bad. Thankfully it was short at around 90 minutes which was a blessing.</p>
