							<h3>The Mystery Of The Disappearing Data</h3>
							<h5>02 Jun 2013</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Once upon a time there was a 500Gb WD Elements USB HDD packed full of my backed up data (code snippets, XBOX stuff, eBooks etc.). I also used this 
drive to store movies. A couple of days ago my daughter wanted to watch one so I showed her what was available and she found some she was interested in. 
I ejected the drive and gave it to her. Yesterday I was in her room connecting up her PC to a new wireless router I&#8217;d just installed and I was asking 
her about the movies. She took me by surprise when she said there was nothing on the drive. &#8220;Nothing on the drive&#8221; I said, &#8220;hmm that&#8217;s strange are you 
sure?&#8221; So I hooked it up to the PC and lo and behold nothing; not one single file. Erm &#8220;what did you do with it&#8221;. &#8220;Nothing&#8221; she says, &#8220;honest&#8221;.</p>

<p>So what the hell happened during the transport of the drive from one PC to another and how do I get my data back?</p>

<p>The answer to the first point is I&#8217;ll never know. I tried questioning the suspect further but I got the same answer. So that&#8217;s a firm dead-end. The next 
question is could I recover the data? Well I&#8217;ve never had to do this before so I wasn&#8217;t aware of a (preferably free) killer application that would 
recover the missing data. So off to <a href="http://www.google.co.uk">Google</a> for some suggestions. The 2 that I chose were <a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva">Recuva</a> 
and <a href="http://www.pandorarecovery.com/">Pandora Recovery</a>.</p>

<p>Both applications basically recovered a similar amount of data which was a small fraction of what was on the drive. I&#8217;m not saying this is the fault 
of the applications more of a limitation due to the state of the drive.</p>

<p>Move forward one day and a massive improvement and a major success. How come? Well I&#8217;m not entirely sure but I plugged the drive into another PC and I 
was advised that Windows had encountered some errors with the drive and would I like to fix them. Since it was knackered anyway I though why not. I opted 
for the full scan and after several hours it reported everything was OK. During that time, I&#8217;d been reading about more free applications which would 
recover files. One of them <a href="http://www.puransoftware.com/File-Recovery.html">Puran File Recovery</a> looked promising so after installing it I proceeded 
to let it loose on the drive. After several hours the process completed and it reported that over 10,000 files could be recovered. What a result. I 
wasn&#8217;t bothered about anything other than all the photos. Thankfully I was able to recover them all.</p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t know whether <a href="http://www.puransoftware.com/File-Recovery.html">Puran File Recovery</a> is the daddy or that things improved when I scanned and 
fixed the drive but whatever it was I&#8217;m just glad to get it sorted. As for the daughter, she doesn&#8217;t care either way.</p>
