title: "Cage The Elephant"

The gig, [Cage The Elephant](http://www.cagetheelephant.com/){:target="_blank"}, had been moved from the University to Academy 2 at the last moment. 
This was disappointing because I love the University venue as it has a great atmosphere (or let's say a better one that Academy 2). I'm not going to 
write a review because (a) I can't be arsed (b) I'd never heard of them before. However what I can say is that they were my least favourite act on 
the night. It'll have to be a tie between the first act [Bleached Wail](http://www.myspace.com/bleachedwail){:target="_blank"} and the second act 
[Young Rebel Set](http://www.myspace.com/youngrebelset){:target="_blank"} (who I have seen before, maybe under a different name, at the University 
supporting [The Twang](http://www.myspace.com/thetwang){:target="_blank"} (I think).

If they weren't told to come off, The Young Rebel Set could have played all night but they were given their marching orders so never even got 
to say "This is our last song".
