title: "Revenge Of The Chilli"
---

I just got a boat-load of tomatoes from my father-in-laws greenhouse so I decided to cook some Chilli Con Carne. During the preparation I fried up onions, 
peppers, peas, mushrooms and chillies. After they were done I picked up the pan and as it passed my face I took a quick smell in through my nostrils.

The Chillies must have been very strong as when their scent was drawn up my nostrils I immediately started to get the feeling that I'd made a school boy error. 
My nose started to get a warm numb feeling. Any air drawn up my nostrils gave me the same feeling as you get in a sauna. Over the next hour this feeling continued 
until the heat had moved all the way up to my eyes. It was agony, I couldn't open my eyes as it was too painful and they were watering so much. No matter what I 
did I couldn't get any relief. Eventually it subsided, I laughed about it then I ate my Chilli Con Carne.

That's a tough lesson to learn and I certainly will not be repeating that in a hurry.
