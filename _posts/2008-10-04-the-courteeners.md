OK people as expected the gig was jumping, maybe not packed, but nevertheless jumping. First up the support act 
[Ida Maria](http://www.idamaria.co.uk/idamaria.php){:target="_blank"}. It's hard for support acts because most people have come to see the main act and no matter how 
much they try sometimes you just can't whip up the audience. Nevertheless they did a good set. But as usual the instruments drowned out what was 
probably a beautiful singing voice.

Now to [The Courteeners](http://www.thecourteeners.com){:target="_blank"}. This is the 3rd time I've seen them and once again they didn't disappoint despite this being 
the largest of the venues. Their catalogue isn't massive but they did a number of new songs and b-sides as well as all the usual fan favourites. 
About half was through the rest of the band left the stage and Liam did a few acoustic numbers. The rest of the band rejoined closing with 
"Not Nineteen Forever".

Next up Steve Winwood Gateshead Sage Stage 1 Mon 06 October 2008.
