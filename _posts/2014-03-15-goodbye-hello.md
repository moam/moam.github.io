title: "Goodbye Scriptogram Hello New Monitor"
---

I finally got round to deleting my Scriptogr.am account. It was a pretty sad event albeit very quick (nice touch pushing me to a Youtube video of a crying cat) but had to be done now that I'm with my new family Jekyll & Github. I find that this is allowing me to publish articles more frequently although I still have to give myself a bit of a kick to remember to do it - after all I'm not a 'professional' blogger just someone who, when he remembers, tries to get some shit down in words on a computer screen.

On a happier note I got myself a new [monitor](http://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-24EN43VS){:target="_blank"}. The kids have had 24" Benq's for some time (what a generous Dad I am) but I was stuck with a 19 incher (oh er missus). But no longer; I'm up there with the 24 inchers now.
