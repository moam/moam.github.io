title: "My Life Without Apps"
---

Yes folks I have to confess I don't possess an iPhone and hence cannot "benefit" from Apps. What a hardship I hear you say, how can he survive? I feel like an 
outcast, like the kid at school who couldn't afford Adidas trainers and had to get Gola. What a looser.

Of course this is in jest (well at least it is to me) but according to the latest Apple adverts to hit my TV screen maybe its closer to reality than I think. The 
advert goes something like

> If you don't have an iPhone you don't have the App Store so you don't have the world largest selection of apps

No kidding Einstein. Big deal so your sad little life is empty because you don't have an app to check-in for your flight or buy a coffee. Come on get a life 
please. You just don't need a Â£500 phone to do that. I'm sure the next time I'm going on a flight I'll just check-in normally at the airport and should I 
choose to buy any beverage (which won't be coffee since I don't drink it) I'll put my hand in my pocket and pay for it using something called money.

This is typical marketing bollocks; people must be lapping it up just gagging to get their hands on an iPhone. Well I can't knock Apple to much because I have an 
iPod which is marvellous but they certainly no how to hook people in with smart marketing for what essentially are pointless gimmicks. Have people forgotten 
life before iPhone? I think they have and are now incapable of doing anything without resorting to an app.

The advert finishes by uttering this totally random sentence which I just don't get. What the hell does it mean?

> If you don't have an iPhone well you don't have an iPhone
