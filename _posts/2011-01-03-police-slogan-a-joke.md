title: "Police Slogan Is A Joke"
---

I read an amusing article in today's [Journal](http://www.journallive.co.uk){:target="_blank"} on page 2 titled "Police's slogan is given a caution". Apparently 
the Plain English Campaign has slammed Northumbria Police's use of expensive marketing slogans described as "pointless" and "meaningless". Their catchphrase of 
"Total Policing" has come under criticism and I agree. I want the Police to spend money on catching criminals not marketing campaigns. A spokesman for Northumbria 
Police defended their slogan.

> This logo has been in use for a number of years and demonstrates our commitment to reducing and preventing crime and meeting the policing needs of our 
community.

What the hell are they on about? Never mind "commitment" it's their bloody job to do those things. You don't need any more incentive than that, you don't need a 
slogan. Idiots. The money would have been better spent getting out and into the communities to ask them what they really want from the Police and that's some hard 
action targeting the real criminals not the easy targets like motorists etc.
