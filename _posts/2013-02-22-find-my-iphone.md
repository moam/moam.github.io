You do have **Find My iPhone** don't you? Yes. Here's how to protect it.

* Select <kbd>Settings</kbd>
* Select <kbd>General</kbd>
* Select <kbd>Restrictions</kbd>
* Select <kbd>Enable Restrictions</kbd> and enter a password
* Find <kbd>Deleting Apps</kbd> and toggle this to OFF (this stops anyone deleting the **Find My iPhone** app)
* Scroll to the **Privacy** section
* Select <kbd>Locations</kbd> Services
* Select <kbd>Don't Allow Changes</kbd>
* Go back to **Restrictions**
* Select <kbd>Accounts</kbd>
* Select <kbd>Don't Allow Changes</kbd>

Don't tell your Service Provider the iPhone or iPad is stolen until after you have talked to the Police! Hopefully you'll never be in this awful 
situation.
