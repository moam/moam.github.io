title: "New Host, New Headache"
---

Just found myself a new host for the site, [JustHostMe](http://www.justhostme.co.uk){:target="_blank"}. Site working fine on local machine, no 
problems. Once uploaded to new host site not working, lots of errors. FFS my local machine must be really forgiving, unless it's due to the fact this 
is a Linux host and I'm using Windows.
