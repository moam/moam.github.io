I went to see [Official Maiden England](http://www.maiden-england.co.uk){:target="_blank"} on Friday night, the second time I've seen them. As you might have 
guessed by their name they're an Iron Maiden tribute band and a pretty good one at that. Not that I'm an expert since I've only seen one but in comparison to 
the real thing, who I've seen many times, they're pretty good.

The venue was [NIKHS Bar](http://www.nikhs.co.uk){:target="_blank"} which in my days was called Reflections. I hadn't been there for over a decade and then that 
was only by chance after a school reunion but it hadn't changed.

The acoustics were pretty poor in the upstairs room which was disappointing but nevertheless they knocked out some of the old favourites like "Wrathchild", 
"Iron Maiden", "Running Free", "Run To The Hills" and many more. Overall it was great night meeting a few friends I hadn't seen for a while and enjoying some live 
music.
