title: "I Love Kielder"
---

I love my annual week in Kielder and always look forward to doing a bit of lazy bird watching in the hope of seeing something which I haven't seen before. This year was no 
exception as I saw a British Jay and a Sparrowhawk for the first time. I was hoping to see some Crossbills but all I got was a brief early morning sighting.

One of the best things about Kielder is the peace, tranquillity and vast openness of the landscape. This forces you to open your eyes and take in your surroundings. This 
is particularly true for the night sky which when cloud free is a wondrous sight. It's truly amazing to see so many stars.  I just wish I could motivate myself to get up 
to the Observatory (when it's open) but I suppose it's a bit pot luck if it turns out to be cloudy.
