If you've read any of my previous posts (and I hope you have) then you'll notice [Barter Books](http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/) features quite a bit. That's 
because I love going there and trying to find myself a good read.

In got the reading bug back after many years of not reading anything more than a newspaper. I can't remember how it happened (there must have been a book 
which acted as a catalyst but I can't remember it) but I'm glad it did because I feel better for it. I find the best time to read is just before I go 
to sleep. It helps me relax but unfortunately I tend to only read for a short time before my eyes are closing so books usually take a long time to read. 
So books with around 200-300 pages are the ones I usually go for.

I had a pile of books I wanted to trade in so a trip to [Barter Books](http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/) was on my itinerary of things to do this week. 
I also fancied a stroll around the lovely town of [Alnwick](http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/) as I expected the weather to be nice and sunny.

I got there early but with it being half-term it was already quite busy. After waiting around 20 minutes for my books to be assessed I was pleased to 
break even so I didn't actually own any money. The books I picked up were

* Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency - Douglas Adams
* On The Symb-Socket Circuit - Kenneth Bulmer
* The Fountains Of Paradise - Arthur C Clarke
* Silent Bob Speaks - Kevin Smith
* The Top Gear Story - Martin Roach
* Jeremy Clarkson The Biography - Gwen Russell
* Death Comes To Pemberley - PD James (for the wife of course)

I made a discrete enquiry regarding Chris Donald but unfortunately I am 5 years too late. He doesn't work there anymore.

After finishing up in [Barter Books](http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/) I took a short stroll into [Alnwick](http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/) town centre 
where I enjoyed a look round the shops and a welcome bite to eat at [Baileys Of Alnwick](https://plus.google.com/104583187534531209948/about?gl=uk&hl=en).
