title: "Hacking Cars"
---

I read an article a few days ago about some clever dudes hacking cars with IP addresses. You weren't seeing things don't worry, yes IP addresses. Now you might 
just wonder like I did, what the hell is this all about.

Cars have been crammed full of electronic systems for years. Soon it is predicted that some cars will have an IP address, in fact the Chevy Volt already has one. 
There is even an iPhone app that lets you unlock and start your car, even if you're many miles away. With all this on-board technology the next big question is 
how long will it be before someone hacks into one?

No time at all it seems. In fact it's already been done. Earlier this year, researchers from the University of California and the University of Washington 
revealed how they hacked into a 2009 saloon car and took control of its brakes, door locks and dashboard display. OK, it took 10 scientists two years to achieve 
this feat but you can be sure that it won't be long before the process becomes much faster.

It's scary to consider that Researchers are looking at automatic billing processes so that people can pay for petrol, road tolls or a car wash without leaving 
their car. Cars will interact with pumps or tolls and conduct the financial transaction on their behalf. Imagine a hacker gaining access to that data which could 
be of a financial nature or even being able to steal the car without the need to physically break in, it's inconceivable. No doubt we'll see a raft of people 
trying to flog you "the best" threat monitoring / intrusion prevention / general managed security services for a "small" add-on fee.

This makes me feel like we're going full circle with cars. Not so long ago you could get into some cars with a tea spoon handle (the locks were that shite) and 
could turn off car alarms with the TV remote control. Brilliant. Now all you need do is get yourself a Smart-phone and some (no doubt) free software and voila 
you've hacked into Mr Posh's motor.

What ever happened to KISS (no, not the 80's makeup wearing, spandex clad rockers) Keep It Simple Stupid. It'll all end in tears.
