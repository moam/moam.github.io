title: TV Hits A New Low
---

While watching TV over the weekend I happened across an ITV2 advert for some new shows it was plugging. Now after witnessing trailers for the most puerile drivel I have ever seen I swear some of my brain cells committed suicide just to avoid enduring any more suffering. Just like the "Howay Blyth" man I shrieked a "Come On" at which point the whole house was wondering what the hell was going on.

We have previously seen many shite shows from ITV2 but they're not the only culprit. I'm embarrassed to list such shite as this but TV low points have included

* Big Brother
* Celebrity Big Brother
* Celebrity Juice
* I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here
* The Only Way Is Essex
* The X-Factor
* The Voice
* Britain's Got Talent
* Splash
* Dancing On Ice
* Strictly Come Dancing
* Anything by Katie Price
* Anything by Peter Andre
* Anything by Kerry Katona

So now you have a list of some of the rubbish that TV can spew out you must be wondering to yourself what can be more shite that these. What can be lower than the bottom of the barrel. Well here goes, don't say I didn't warn you.

* Party Wright Around the World
* Educating Joey Essex
* Tom Daley Takes on the World

Who the hell pays for this crap. I cannot believe some top executive actually thinks these are good. They must be off their rockers and have money to burn. If I could I wouldn't pay my TV Licence in protest. I am deeply insulted that someone thinks these make good TV. There is nothing good about these shows.
