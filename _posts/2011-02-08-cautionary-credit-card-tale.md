title: "A Cautionary Credit Card Tale"
---

There was an article in today's Metro which really stuck a chord. "Child's Â£1000 Xbox bill for mum" is the headline.  It tells the tale of a young gamer aged 11 
who racked up the bill on his mothers credit card through his Xbox.

Now I can relate to that because my wife and son "accidently" bought 500 Microsoft points. It was easy since my credit card was already linked to my son's live 
account and appeared in the payment screen. I made myself very clear to him not to "accidently" do it again and he's got the message. Anyway I trust him.

Microsoft, helpful as ever, insisted that a parental control setting would have prevented this from occurring. Just push the blame back onto someone else why don't 
you.
