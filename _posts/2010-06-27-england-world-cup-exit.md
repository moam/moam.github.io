title: "Woeful England World Cup Exit"
---

I feel utterly ashamed to be English at the moment. Not because we have been comprehensively beaten by the Germans (again) or because of their dismal 
individual performances but simply because here we have a group of people who are meant to be the top of their profession representing their country, 
the highest honour that can be given to anyone, who simply had no passion, no will to win, no sense of pride, no drive, no determination and most of 
all no creativity.
