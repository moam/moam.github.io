##### DIY Rip-Off

A 5A fuse blew in my consumer unit (that's what you get for using cheap Supermarket lights) so I needed one PDQ. I immediately thought of my local B&Q but wait £3 for one 
fuse, you got to be kidding. CEF were slightly better but still, in my opinion, expensive at £1.75. I happened to look at Amazon and found a seller knocking out 5 for £2.50. 
Order placed, job done. So much for your DIY stores.</p>', '2012-01-31 20:57:19', 0),

#####DIY Cooker Repair Nightmare

Why do manufacturers make it so difficult to carry out repairs? The cooker element blew today so I thought it would be an easy job to change it (having changed the one in 
our last cooker on an alarmingly regular annual basis). Think again, the retaining screws or bolts are on the back of the cooker housing instead of more conveniently being 
on the inside. So I have to take the whole cooker out to change the element. Happy days, just what Saturday's are made for!
