title: "Work Based Chuggers"
---

Chuggers or 'Charity Muggers' on the high street have never bothered me because you're in an open space and can easily ignore them or if you're careful bypass 
them altogether. But when you're at work it's a different story. You're in a confined space and usually these people are colleagues who you know. So saying NO to 
their latest charity drive can be awkward.

Take the last few days for example. It's close to Red Nose Day and it's unbelievable how many 'money buckets' rattle round the office. I know it's for a good 
cause but I'm sick and tired of this kind of Chugging. I have a simple policy and that's to say NO to anyone who asks me to make a contribution. Call me what you 
like but it saves me forking out a small fortune in the fortnight leading up to the event not to mention the day itself.

Unfortunately saying NO gets the same reaction as if you'd just told them to fuck off - they look at you like you're a piece of shit. But I stand by my policy. 
After all I pay a lot of tax which the government, bless them, decide to gift to many foreign countries. As they say charity begins at home and I for one intent 
to spend any spare money I have in that very place treating my family now and again.
