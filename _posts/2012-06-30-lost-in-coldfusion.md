title: "Lost in Coldfusion"
---

I haven't had time to post anything or even think about this site since I got the opportunity to get involved in a project at work using Coldfusion and MS SQL. It's been a 
great experience and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. My first step was to reverse engineer the code on an existing site which, with all due respect to the individual who wrote 
it, was very messy with some really unintelligible variable names that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. The code wasn't indented very well which made it hard to 
interpret. Even so I managed to get my head around it very quickly and if I do say so myself it's much better now.

I'm starting to build in extra functionality like using Coldfusion's excellent charting capabilities and introduce some much needed CSS to make it look better. Some of the 
bugs that irritated the users have now been ironed out much to everyone's relief.
