title: "More Howlers From The 10th LGBT Conference In Leeds"
---

Linda Roy (National Equalities Officer) provides yet another baffling quote at this year's LGBT (for those that don't know Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) 
Conference where she

> praised the efforts of the athletes at the Olympics and Paralympics Games but regretted that of 10,000 athletes involved only 20 were openly gay. She felt that given 
the average of between 3 and 8 per cent of the population being LGBT there must be many athletes who felt unable to come out about their sexuality

Eh what the hell is she on about? It was an sporting (athletics) event, why would there be a need for anyone to be discussing their sexuality?
