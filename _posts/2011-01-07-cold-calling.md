title: "Cold Calling Makes My Blood Boil"
---

Who are these people who ring you up at inappropriate times and start asking you personal questions so they can confirm who you are. Never mind that, I want to 
know who the hell they are and why they are calling.

Take today for example. The phone rings at an inappropriate time.

* Idiot : Can I speak to Mr Dobson?
* Me : Who wants to know?
* Idiot : It's a courtesy call?
* Me : About what?
* Idiot : I can discuss that with Mr Dobson, can I speak to him?
* Me : Who wants to know?
* Idiot: It's a courtesy call?
* Me : Listen you call me up and start asking me personal questions, it should be the other way round. Who the hell are you and what do you want?
* Idiot : It's a courtesy call?
* Me : Arrgh, about what?
* Idiot: I'm calling from an Accident Claims Company?
* Me : Right where did you get my details from?
* Idiot : We get our details from those Car Insurance Price Comparison sites
* Me : That figures cheeky beggars. I have only used that type of site once and look where it's got me. I'm glad I don't use them.
* Idiot : Is that Mr Dobson?
* Me : Yes
* Idiot : Have you had a claim within the last 18 months?
* Me : No, goodbye.

I have the utmost sympathy for someone doing that job as it must be soul destroying and the greatest respect for the lady who called me as she did not flinch 
even when I was in full Mr Grumpy mode.
