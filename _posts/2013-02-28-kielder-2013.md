I had another fantastic time in Kielder. This year I was determined not to get too upset if I wasn't out walking every minute of daylight. I just 
wanted a peaceful and relaxing break. And that is exactly what I got. Although we didn't get any rain it was bitterly cold, the kind that chills you to 
the bone. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary this time although I did see a couple of [Bramblings](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/brambling/index.aspx) 
which I'm sure I haven't seen before (they look very similar to a [Chaffinch](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/c/chaffinch/index.aspx) 
if you're not taking too much notice of the hoard descending on the feeders).

FYI the [RSPB](http://www.rspb.org.uk/) site is excellent.
