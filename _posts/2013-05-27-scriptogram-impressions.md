title: "Scriptogram - First Impressions"
---

**I no longer host a site on Scriptogram - see this [post](http://moam.github.io/2014/01/11/moving-to-github-jekyll.html)**

After working with [scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am) and [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) for a few days, albeit on a very basic level, here are a few 
of my observations.

What I like

* It's FREE
* Simply way of creating posts and pages using a text editor and some basic [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax.
* You can customise (edit CSS and HTML) till your heart's content
* Proxima Nova (used in the Basic Theme) is a beautiful font
* Did I mention it's FREE

Quirks

* Auto synchronisation should be a feature to save having to do it manually each time you make a change (which is often if you've got my grammar 
and spelling skills)
* Published: True doesn't seem to work so you need to omit it or remove the line (from your post or page document) if you've had it set to False
* You have to 'Allow' the connection between Scriptogram and Dropbox every time you log in although I thought this was a one-time activity.
* The Knowledge Base is fairly sparce
* The Public Discussion forum has a lot of topics but not many are being answered
* Code doesn't display correctly in IE10
* Social links don't display correctly in IE10
* Since when is 27 February in March - see my [Archive](http://scriptogr.am/sdobson/archive) page

To Do

* Embedded images
* Embedded video / audio
* <del>Get to 11 posts so I can test my pagination CSS / HTML</del>
* <del>Import some or all of the posts on my [current](http://sdobson.no-ip.org) site</del>
