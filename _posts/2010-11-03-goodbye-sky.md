title: "Good Bye SKY"
---

I finally said goodbye to SKY. I'd simply had enough of watching channel after channel of repeats whilst paying out a lot of money every month. I didn't even 
think I would miss SKY1 since I obtain my TV shows from other sources so wouldn't lose out with Fringe etc. The news didn't go down to well with the multi-room 
users but I'm boss and that was that.

What I didn't realise was that SKY+ would be disabled when I unsubscribed. [Polite mode enabled] That is very unfair. So now I have a useless white box under my 
TV.

To add insult to injury a few days after cancelling the subscription I got a letter from SKY informing me that my direct debit had been cancelled. But wait for 
it, they would charge me £4 "admin fee" if I owed them any money and paid it using a method other than direct debit. Of course you know me I'd already confirmed 
that they actually owned me a refund so I ignored it. A few days later I got another letter saying that my SKY box was not connected to the phone line. 
You don't say! The final straw came a week later when I got another letter regarding my direct debit. So I called SKY and asked them what the hell was going on. 
I got some crap about it being an automated letter blah blah blah. So I said to them listen, you own me money so if you don't refund it to me within 7 days I 
will charge YOU a £4 "admin fee". Is that alright? Stunned silence. Enough said.
