title: Where Have You Been
---

I've always been here, I've just been waiting in a mountain for the right moment - sorry [Bjork](http://bjork.com/)

I've had a terrible 3 years. The reason for that is private and I don't want to discuss it publically.
So does that mean everything is now OK? No. Is easier the right word, hmm not sure. Less painful maybe. I can't explain.
But since I was setting up a new computer and didn't know what to do with myself I decided to resurrect this project and see where it takes me.

Not promising it will be updated very often, since I discovered Twitter and Instragram, but you never know.
