title: "David Kushner - Masters of Doom"
---

I heard about this book after reading an article in a magazine in which it was mentioned. I thought it would be an interesting read as I'd grown up with DOOM. 
Although I was never a hardcore gamer I'd played the game and enjoyed it. Learning a bit about the history behind it would be interesting. It didn't disappoint, 
I can honestly say that this book was one of the best I have read. Not only was it well researched and written but it was also a bloody good read.

I read how John Romero and John Carmack had graduated from video game playing to programming and game development. I dabble a bit in simple programming and am 
very jealous of how easily the seemed to pick it up and what they did with their skills. John Carmack is a legend, being able to develop the game engine and the 
design tools to make the levels is totally awesome. I can only imagine what a privilege it must have been to work with them both (albeit very frustrating in equal 
amounts I would imagine).

If you are in any way interested in the early days of PC gaming you should read this book, you won't be disappointed. If I was to criticize the book it would be 
that it didn't have any pictures which would have helped to put names to faces and I felt the end sort of fizzled out but I suppose that's what happens on a 
rollercoaster, you have a long high during the ride and at the end you come back down quickly.

Thanks to the author for taking time to research and write the book, thanks to WH Smith for having it in stock and getting it to me so quickly and finally, thanks 
to the Two Johns for making such an awesome game.
