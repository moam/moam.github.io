I've had this for a long time and have been meaning to make a page out of it but never got round to it. Finally here it is. This was originally 
published in one of the NE newspapers (maybe Evening Chronicle or Journal) so I claim none of it as my own work. I don't even have a date for the 
article but it's next to one about England fans being prevented from taking flag poles into Sunderland's Stadium of Light for a friendly match 
with Belgium.

I only live a short drive from Ashington but my accent is totally different (although some people say I have a strong accent) so for those wanting 
to venture to the world's largest mining village and the birth place of legends Jackie Milburn and Bobby & Jackie Charlton here is a handy *aide memoir* 
to translation.
