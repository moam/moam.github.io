title: "iPod Touch Screen Replacement"
---

Well my efforts to repair a cracked screen failed miserably.

I started with high hopes having just watched a video which made it look easy and at first everything was going well. I had just about removed the 
glass screen / digitizer but didn't realise that the top left-hand corner was stuck and as a gently lifted it away from the unit it must have caught 
the LCD screen and lifted it up as well cracking it. I couldn't believe it, FFS.

So off I go to Asda to buy another one, Â£147 thank you very much.

I removed the broken LCD which was pretty easy so at the moment I'm considering taking another punt and buying the replacement parts and trying to 
fix it. This should hopefully be a lot easier since I'll just be fitting them back together. He says!!
