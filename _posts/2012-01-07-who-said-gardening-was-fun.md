title: "Who The Hell Said Gardening Was Fun"
---

I like a garden but keeping it nice is a pain. So today in the spirit of getting my arse outside and getting some of the new year jobs out the way promptly I decided to 
trim back my apple tree as it was getting a bit out of hand. It took me ages to cut it back, break down the branches and put them in my brown garden waste bin. The wife's 
helpful comment was "it's looks bloody awful", queue a suitable unprintable rebuff.
