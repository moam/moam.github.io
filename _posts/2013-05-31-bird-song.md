title: "Bird Song"
---

I love this time of year. The mornings and nights are lighter and generally (don't laugh) the weather gets better (ok you can laugh I won't hold it against 
you). When I take the dog for a walk first thing in the morning and last thing at night you hear the wonderful chorus of bird song. It has to be one of 
the most wonderful sounds you'll ever hear. From the [Blackbirds](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackbird/index.aspx), 
[Starlings](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/s/starling/index.aspx) and [Goldfinches](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/g/goldfinch/index.aspx) 
high up on the TV aerials to the [House Sparrows](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/h/housesparrow/index.aspx), 
[Dunnocks](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/d/dunnock/index.aspx) and [Blue Tits](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/bluetit/index.aspx) 
in the shrubs.

It's always a glorious site to see the garden full of birds. I have a regular nesting pair of 
[House Sparrows](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/h/housesparrow/index.aspx) who must use a convenient gap between my roof tiles and 
felt. I also get [Blackbirds](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackbird/index.aspx) who come for the half apples I leave out. I've tried 
to attract some additional visitors this year by putting up a bird feeding station but my dog and the numerous cats that live round the area mean that 
it hasn't been used as much as I'd like. Still I've had [Goldfinches](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/g/goldfinch/index.aspx) and 
[Blue Tits](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/bluetit/index.aspx) which is a good start.
