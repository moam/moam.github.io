title: "UK Pathetic On Asylum Seekers #2"
---

FFS this is getting to be a habit and I blame the Metro and the Daily Express.

Another tale in today's Metro, not as bad as before but in the same vein. The article describes how a Ugandan woman won a further (implying there have been more 
than one) court order preventing her from being deported by claiming she was a lesbian.

The woman who should have been deported on January 28 said she feared for her life in Uganda where there is hostility towards homosexuals. Now that is mighty 
convenient wouldn't you say, and I do. I doubt that when she arrives back in Uganda there is going to be a "welcoming" party waiting outside ready to lynch her. 
She'll just be another face in the crown, unless she's wearing a big sign saying "lesbian" or something particular about her that says "look at me I'm a 
lesbian". If it's so bad in Uganda then she needs to keep a low profile. I don't agree with it but you have to deal with local conditions as best as you can. 
It's not a reason to seek asylum in another country. FFS next we'll be getting people coming in claiming they can't be deported because they'll be ridiculed for 
having a large nose or big ears.

The final insult is an immigration judge found she was not gay. I wonder how they came to that conclusion. Keep it clean!
