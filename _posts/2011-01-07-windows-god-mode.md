title: "Windows 7 GodMode"
---

Here's a cool Windows 7 trick that's been doing the rounds on the Internet. It enables "GodMode", a term devised (apparently) by the Microsoft development team 
although they claim it was coined by bloggers, which provides a single place to access all Windows settings without needing to browse options and folders in the 
Control Panel.

To use it create or rename a new folder to

**GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}**

The folder icon will change - click (or double click) it to show the "GodMode" window.

Further research has revealed that it doesn't have be named **"GodMode.{..."** it can be any text as long as the GUID is the same.
