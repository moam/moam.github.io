Yes folks I went to see [It Bites](http://www.itbites.com){:target="_blank"} who were supported by 
[Touchstone](http://www.touchstonemusic.co.uk){:target="_blank"} at the Carling Academy 2 on 01 October 2008.

The band covered old classics like "All In Red", "Kiss Like Judas", "Old Man And The Angel", "Plastic Dreamer" and "Still Too Young To Remember" 
plus a two song acoustic set starting out with "Once Around The World" (at which point I admit I got excited because I love this song) but they only 
did about the first 5 minutes (the song is about 13 minutes long) but still worth it and finished with another full song but I can't remember which 
one it was. They also covered some from their new album which wasn't out at the time so I hadn't heard them. One surprising omission was 
"Calling All The Heroes" but it didn't spoil the night.

Next up is the Courteeners Fri 03 October 2008 also at the Carling Academy.
