This kind of story really makes my blood boil because it demonstrates how truly pathetic some people are. You're busy getting on with your life in a quiet and 
unassuming way and some arsehole comes along and defies rational logic.

So what the hell am I referring to? Well we turn to the Metro, everyone's favourite free newspaper, once again. In today's edition a news snippet tells how posh 
TV Presenter Ben Fogle was threatened with a fine after his energy-saving car was deemed to be "parked" at a junction. His car has a stop/start eco-engine and it 
turned off at traffic lights. A warden threatened to ticket him as he was "parked". What idiot would do that? He should have been knocked out for that then sacked 
for gross incompetence.

If that wasn't enough for poor Ben he was also suffering after hurting his leg the previous week while tackling a fox which had attacked his dogs. What a bloke.
