title: "Serious Sam HD First And Second Encounter"
---

I grabbed this as I remember someone saying that it was a fun no nonsense game where you basically just shot the crap out of anything that moved. It wasn't like I 
needed a new game as I'd just finished Bulletstorm and Homefront and had just started Crysis 2 but I grabbed it anyway.

Unfortunately having just played 2 FPS and onto my 3rd in quick succession I'd got a bit bored so decided to try out Serious Sam First Encounter. If I'm honest I 
got bored with Crysis 2 as I was expecting some kick-ass game and it didn't turn out to be that way for me. At first I enjoyed the simplicity of Serious Sam. Yes 
there wasn't much finesse, just blast the crap out of everything, but after a while it got very tedious - it just wasn't fun after the first few missions. I even 
tried Second Encounter but even that didn't improve things.

I've given up on it for the moment and put in the "may go back to it" pile.
