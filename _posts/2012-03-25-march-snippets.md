##### Being A Parent Sucks

I often wonder how my kids at times can be so ungrateful. I'm not a bad parent, I've never refused them anything, I give them more freedom that I ever got as a teenager 
and yet still they throw things back in your face. Maybe I was also like that, I can't remember. Ah well I suppose that's the "joy" of being a parent.

##### A Number 7 Omen

When I got into the car this morning the clock read 07:07 and the tripometer read 77.7 miles.

##### Ladybird Invasion

I noticed that there are a lot of Ladybirds out and about in the garden this year which is brilliant. I love ladybirds and will be doing as much as I can to encourage 
them. I hope the fact that I did a hatchet job on my apple trees won't have a negative impact.

##### James Bond Double-Entendre

I was channel surfing and caught a few minutes of Moonraker. Only in a James Bond film could a female doctor be called "Dr Goodhead". Brilliant.
