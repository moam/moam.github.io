title: "Worthless Adverts"
---

I was listening to the radio today and I heard an advert from British Gas. It said 

> British Gas understand no one likes holding on the phone, which is why their call back service lets you get on with your day. They understand that your time 
is precious, that's why they're committed to answering your call in 60 seconds. If they can't, they'll offer to call you back.

Great but when does this call back take place? In a hours time, by the end of the day, the following day, in a week's time? It isn't specified.

And of course there is the usual small print at the end i.e. applies to Customer Service calls only. So no other department in Gritish Bas gives a flying f**k 
how long they take to answer?

That's the power of advertising. Make you feel like you're getting something for nothing when in fact you're getting nothing at all.
