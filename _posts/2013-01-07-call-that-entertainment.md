title: "Call That Entertainment"

So there is a new 'entertainment' line up for Saturday and Sunday evening's on BBC & ITV. According to this weeks TV Choice (which incidentally was 
only 30p) some of them are shows 'YOU MUST NOT MISS!'. So let's have a closer look at what all the excitement is about.

* BBC1 - Animal Antics
* BBC1 - Richard Hammond's Secret Service
* BBC1 - Britians Brightest
* ITV - Splash!
* ITV - Take Me Out
* ITV - The Jonathan Ross Show
* ITV - Dancing on Ice
* ITV - Mr Selfridge

Now Saturday TV in particular has always been shite but this is taking the absolute piss. If this is entertainment then I'd rather watch paint dry. I 
have better things to do with my life than waste it away watch this mindless crap.

It's about time that we got rid of this crazy TV licence and either made the BBC free (like ITV, C4 & C5) or made it subscription based so at least you 
had a choice whether you wanted to pay or not. With the advent of 'on demand' TV it is essential that people are allowed free choice rather than being 
forced to pay for a service which is frankly woeful.
