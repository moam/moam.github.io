It was a sad day today as my cat passed away at the ripe old age of 17. She led a very good life and was well looked after. Her health had deteriorated over the 
last few months as she developed a nasty cough which seemed to take the wind out of her. Her back legs were also giving way and occasionally she would just keel 
over.

She seemed well enough in the morning and was her usual vocal self when we came in with the shopping. Later on in the afternoon she has a particularity sever 
attack. On this occasion it looked bad. After staggering into the conservatory she seemed like she was going to recover but as she lay down I could tell she was 
on the way out. I tried to comfort her but she just wasn't responding. Her breathing was very measured and she was taking in great gasps of air. I decided to 
leave her in peace. Shortly after I looked into the conservatory and could see that she wasn't breathing. It was very upsetting.

We never really saw eye to eye. Her fine fur and the mess she made in her later life with the litter tray didn't agree with me. I always thought it would be a 
relief when she passed away but it wasn't. It was a very sad occasion as she had been part of my life for so long. Ironically it was also the 2nd birthday of my 
dog. RIP Maisey.
