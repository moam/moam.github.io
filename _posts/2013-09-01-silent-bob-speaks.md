##### The Collected Writings of Kevin Smith - ISBN 1-84576-080-8

I picked this up at [Barter Books](http://www.barterbooks.co.uk/). Having heard of Kevin Smith but not knowing much about the man, other than briefly 
seeing *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back*, I though I'd see what he was all about.

This seemed to be a collection of articles written for various magazines. Some humorous, some not (IMHO). I read the book from cover to cover, some 330 
pages, but in the end I wasn't converted into a Kevin Smith fan. Fans will probably know all this shit anyway but for curious this is well worth a read 
to get you a small insight into the genius film maker who is Kevin Smith.

This prompted me to hunt out and watch *Clerks* and *Chasing Amy* both of which I enjoyed but wasn't blown over by them. I also managed to get my hands the double DVD 
*An Evening With Kevin Smith*. If I'd had as much enthusiasm as his audiences then this would have been very enjoyable however in the end I found it all a bit nauseating. 
I guess that's why I'm not a fan of comedians. Don't get me wrong I like a laugh but that humour just doesn't do it for me.
