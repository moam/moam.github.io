title: "Dab Radio & iPod Dock"
---

I bought myself a [Pure Chronos iDock Series II Stereo Bedside Digital and FM Radio with Dock for iPod/iPhone](http://www.pure.com/products/product.asp?Product=VL-61270&Category=){:target="_blank"} 
(phew) which I have to say is very impressive. Not quite as impressive as the [ONKYO CR325UKD](http://www.eu.onkyo.com/products/CS-325UK.html){:target="_blank"} 
I have which came with a free dock of it's own but nevertheless good enough for the bedroom.
