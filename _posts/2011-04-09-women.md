You've got to love the ladies but sometimes they are on a different planet, just not in tune with us blokes. So I was rather amused when a colleague of mine sent 
through a couple of classic Men v Women jokes and I thought I'd share them with you

* To find a woman you need Time and Money therefore Woman = Time x Money
* "Time is Money" so Time = Money
* Therefore Woman = Money x Money or (Woman = Money^2)
* "Money is the root of all problems" therefore Money = SQRT(Problems)
* So Woman = (SQRT(Problems))^2
* Therefore Woman = Problems
