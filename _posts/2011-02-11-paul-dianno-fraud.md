title: "Paul Di'Anno Benefit Fraud"
---

I was flicking through the Metro and I saw an article about Paul Di''Anno, the ex Iron Maiden singer. I thought he was in a bad way as I'd seen some footage of 
him on YouTube and he was bloody awful (even though I have one of his solo albums which is very good) but this was a shocker. Paul what the fuck have you been 
doing with yourself? Benefit fraud WTF.

Paul Andrews (his real name) admitted swindling taxpayers out of more than Â£45,000. Andrews pocketed Government handouts by claiming he suffered nerve damage to 
his back that prevented him from working. Ironically, and one could say rather naively, he was caught when DWP investigators spotted a YouTube video of him 
jumping around on stage during a live show in 2006.

This sparked my interest in him again so much that I have ordered his autobiography - titled "The Beast" - from Amazon.
