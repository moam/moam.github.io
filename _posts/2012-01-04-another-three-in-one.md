##### Roadside Cafe Vans

Just see this on way back from Metro Centre - "The Butty Box" (A1 Gosforth) & "The Frying Scotsman" (A19 Cramlington). Who the hell stops at the side of the road and has 
some food from a roadside van?

##### Death On The High Street

Went to the Metro Centre and was amazed at the number of closing down sales - ELC, Mothercare, Hawkins Bazaar, Ann Harvey, Whittard of Chelsea. So sad.

##### Primark

Went looking for underwear, socks and hankies - found them all in [Primark](http://www.primark.co.uk){:target="_blank"} at a reasonable price.
