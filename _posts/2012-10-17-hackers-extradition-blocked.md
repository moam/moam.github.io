title: "Hackers Extradition Blocked"
---

I'm starting a list of all the reasons why I should not be hauled in front of Her Majesty's finest if I'm every caught hacking and/or doing anything illegal like 
downloading the odd film, TV show, album etc. First up I'll do a Gary McKinnon or Talha Ahsan (either will do) and claim that I'm a depressive, suicidal Asperger's 
Syndrome sufferer. Then there's the deafness - my wife will surely vouch for that as she claims I never listen to her.
