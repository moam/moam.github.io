title: "Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary"

I just completed this game and overall really enjoyed it. There were however a couple of things which pissed me off big time and they were "The Flood" and the Warthog 
section in the last mission - that thing handles like a bag of shite. I'd really enjoyed the game until The Flood showed up and after that the endlessly repeating levels 
and waves of those bloody squid like things was just annoying and boring.
