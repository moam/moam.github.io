title: "Got Gold Get Cash"
---

Whilst chatting with the wife the subject got round to those adverts suggesting you sell your gold. Now apart from watches and a wedding ring (which I 
lost, sorry love) I have never owned any jewellery never mind the gold variety. But after a bit of a rummage the wife found some she had lying around. 
We looked at some advertisements in the paper and asked around friends and the general consensus seemed to be to take it to the 
[Newcastle Jewellery Company](http://www.newcastlediamondcompany.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}.  After weighing the stuff we worked out a rough price, 
which we were pleased with. A few days later we drove to Newcastle and visited the store. What a shock, bearing in mind our kitchen scales are not that 
accurate and it was difficult to get an exact weight, we achieved double what we estimated. We were over the moon. I would not only recommend selling 
your unwanted gold but I would also recommend going to the Newcastle Jewellery Company for a quick and painless result.
