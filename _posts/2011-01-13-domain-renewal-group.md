title: "The Domain Renewal Group"
---

I got a nice letter from the Domain Renewal Group (Domain Name Renewal Services). They seem to know a lot about me and my domain requirements but who the hell are 
they?

They're nothing to do with my existing hosting provider so what's it all about? Well these are one of the sneaky bastards who trawl the register looking for 
domains that are about to expire. They write to you using an official looking letter asking you to renew your domain through them. The letter starts

> As a courtesy [WTF nice] to domain name holders, we are sending you this reminder that your domain name registration is due to expire in the next few months. 
When you switch to the Domain Renewal Group, you can take advantage of our best savings. Your registration for sdobson.com will expire on ... Act today!

That's very generous and thoughtful of them. They are jolly good chaps. But that's not all, they also provide you a contact number which is in the USA. Superb. 
But wait what about my existing domain provider how much will they charge me? Well they charge Â£8 for a .com for 1 year. BUT, I get mine free with a hosting 
package. So there generous offer is not very good after all.

If I hadn't had my wits about me then I may have taken this letter on face value. Instead I ripped it up and put it in the recycle bin where it belongs. Hopefully 
I'll be wiping my arse on it one day.
