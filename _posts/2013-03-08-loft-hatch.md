title: "I Fitted A Loft Hatch"
---

The list of jobs to do round the house keeps getting longer by the day so I had to try and make a start. This one was something I should have done 
years ago since the old hatch was knackered but motivation and all that. So I popped along to my nearest [TravisPerkins](http://www.travisperkins.co.uk/) 
and grabbed myself a Manthorpe <kbd>Drop Down Loft Access Door</kbd>

Unfortunately, and not unexpected, the size of the existing opening wasn't the same as the size required for the new hatch (fortunately it was larger). 
Where do these house builders get their stuff from because it's always a size which you can never find (my ex-patio doors were the same, I just couldn't 
get ones to fit the existing opening). So after a bit of trimming I'd got the opening to the correct size. Then it was just a matter of positioning it 
and screwing it into position. Job done, time for a muffin.
