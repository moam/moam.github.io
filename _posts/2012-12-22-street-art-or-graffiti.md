title: "Street Art Or Graffiti"
---

I became more aware of and interested in "street art" after watching a series of programmes broadcast on Channel 4 earlier this year. This led me purchase several books 
including

* London Hand Styles
* Street Knowledge - King Adz
* Banksy The Man Behind The Wall - Will Ellsworth-Jones (which I have just recently finished)

So while going about my daily business I noticed a piece of work, probably more on the "graffiti" side of the fence rather than "street art", in my local town which caught 
my eye. Not because of its artistic quality but just because I'm not used to seeing anything so elaborate. Anything beyond a simple tag is unusual. And I thought the 
Banksy reference was rather amusing.

Apparently

> this image can be attributed to Delmare who along with Chad are a pair of guerilla artists from Blyth Northumberland trying to emulate Banksy

So now you know.

**Update 23/02/14** - this piece of work has been removed as the Wallaw has been converted into a [Weatherspoons](http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-wallaw){:target="_blank"}.
