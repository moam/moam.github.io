title: "Borderlands 2"

I got my hands on a copy of Borderlands 2 for the XBOX. I was looking forward to playing this game as I enjoyed the first one immensely but my initial reaction I have to 
say was mixed. There are a lot of pointless side quests which after a while are boring. The "slaughter house" quests are a real pain and doing wave after wave of the same 
thing is totally boring. On the up side the vehicle sections have almost disappeared and the new enemies are fun and challenging. I'm looking forward to the final boss 
battles.
