title: "Going Russian"
---

On a recent business trip I had the opportunity to go out for an evening meal in Glasgow. I like my food but am not a connoisseur, anything does me, but when 
someone suggested going to a Russian restaurant I was up for a first.

It was quite a trek so I was hoping that it was going to be worthwhile. We eventually arrived at [Cafe-Gallery Cossachok](http://www.cossachok.com0{:target="_blank"}. It 
was modern looking with a large glass entrance. There weren't many people in the restaurant, which is normally not a good sign, but it was pretty quiet on the 
streets so I didn't think about that for too long. It was very clean and well laid out. The decoration was minimal but very tasteful and not over the top. 
For my starter I ordered Borscht and for my main course I ordered Chakhokhbili. I'm not a massive beetroot fan but I was pleasantly surprised at how all the 
flavours in the soup combined together to make it very sweet. I wasn't keen on the bread that accompanied the soup but I''m not one for leaving anything so just 
ate it anyway. No problems with the main course though, it was delicious, beautiful pieces of chicken in a spicy tomato sauce. The rice was also cooked to 
perfection. I wasn't going to have a dessert but since everyone else was having something I went for the Kutuzov Cake which once again was delicious. 
Overall I'd have to give it a 5 star rating. I'd definitely go back even if I had to pay for it myself.
